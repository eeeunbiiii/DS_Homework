# 3D Array Allocation and Addition
This code provides a basic demonstration of 3D array operations and memory management in C.

## How to Run
To run this code, you need a 'Microsoft Visual Studio'. Just open the Visual Studio Solution(.sln) file and run it (crtl+F5).

if you do not have a Visual Studio tool, you need a C compiler, such as GCC, installed on your system. and following each step.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the code files (C source code file is located in \Assignment02-2_code_2271069_고은비\Assignment02-2_code_2271069_고은비)
3. Compile the code using the following command :
`gcc -o Assignment02_code_2271069_고은비.c`
4. Run the compiled program :
`./Assignment02_code_2271069_고은비`

## Code Structure
- mem_Alloc_3D_double: receives quadruple pointer for memory allocation in a 3D array. and then allocates memory for a 3D double array and initializes its elements.
- addition_3D: Performs addition on two 3D arrays using pointers and prints the result.
- main: The main function demonstrates how to use the above functions by allocating two 3D arrays, adding them, and deallocating.

## Customization
- If you want to perform different operations on the arrays, you can modify the `addition_3D` function or create new functions as needed.
